### This code is my first solution to the Google Code Jam practice problem found at the above url. My solution is written in java. 

Input looks like:
    3
    this is a test
    foobar
    all your base

where the integer on the first line specifies the number of lines to follow.

Output should look like:
    Case #1: test a is this
    Case #2: foobar
    Case #3: base your all

where the order of the words on each line is reversed.
